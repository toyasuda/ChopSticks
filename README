DESCRIPTIONS

   chopsticks trim <chromosome no.> <accession table> <sam file> <gff/bed file>

      Improves resolution of deletion calls by trimming ends of deletion calls.

      <chromosome no.>
          ChopSticks focuses on the specified chromosome.
      <accession table>
          This file should contains in each line a pare of tab-delimited a chromosome
          numbers and sequence names.
          ChopSticks recognizes chromosome numbers even if reference names are
          not written as chromosome numbers.
      <sam file>
          Results of mapping NGS sequence to the genome sequence,
          generated by sequence aligners (ex. BWA).
      <gff/bed file>
          Deletion calls to be used.

      OUTPUT:
         Unless a format is specified by -F option, the following output will be written
         to the standard output.
         (1) 'V' is written as a first character of each line.
         (2) Identification number assigned to the deletion.
         (3) Average coverage in the deletion call.
         (4) [<Starting position of the deletion>,<Ending position of the deletion>)
         (5) Improved position of the deletion.

      EXAMPLE:
         chopstick -Fbed -V -f0.8 -k2 trim 1 acc2chr.txt alignment.bam deletions.bed > improved.bed


   chopsticks evidence <chromosome no.> <accession table> <sam file> <gff/bed file>

      Find sequences that support deletion calls given in <gff/bed file>.
      The command-line arguments are the same as 'trim' subcommand above.

      OUTPUT:
         (1) standard out
            SAM output of reads that overlap with deletion calls.
            If -B option is given, threshold on minimum distance for discordant pair,
            distance between two reads, and whether the read is discordant or not will be
            output with YT,YL and YD option values.
         (2) standard error: if -OV is given, tab-delimited values of the following.
           (2-1) The first 6 values in each line of BED files, separated by ','.
           (2-2) Read-pairs that span the deletion call.
                 For each read-pair, its name, its library, and whether the read is
                 discordant('d') or concordant('c') are reported.
                 Each read of the spanning reads must be within the distance
                 given -L option.

      EXAMPLE:
         chopstick -OV -V -L10000 -BBDcfg.txt -M20 evidence 1 acc2chr.txt alignment.bam deletions.bed > spanning.sam 2> spanning-reads.txt
