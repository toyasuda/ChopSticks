This document explains how to use scripts that generates simulated NGS reads.


Usage: perl fasta2fq.pl [options] <length of reads> <mean> <sd> <coverage> <output base name> <fasta file>


DESCRIPTIONS

   Generates simulated NGS reads in FASTQ format based on a given genome sequence
   given as <FASTA file>. The length of reads will be <length of reads>.
   Insert sizes of each pair is distributed according to a normal distribution
   whse mean and standard deviation are given by <mean> and <sd>, respectively.
   The file names of generated FASTQ files are <output base name>_1.fq and
   <output base name>_2.fq. The fasta file must contain exactly one sequence.
   Here are options available:

   -Q<symbol of quality value>
       Specifies the quality value of bases by a character code of a symbol.
       The default is 'I'. This value is used for all bases generated by
       this script.

   -r<seed>
       Specifies the seed of random numbers to be genrated. By giving the
       seed explicitly with this option, you can make bed2fasta.pl generates
       exactly the same simulated genome whenever you execute this script.

   -w<number of bases in each line>
       Generates SNPs at each base with probability given by this option.

EXAMPLE

   perl fasta2fq.pl -r123 100 200 50 1 simread chr1.fa

   This command generates pairs of reads whose depth of coverage is 1,
   the length of reads is 100, mean and standard deviation of insert sizes
   is 200 and 50, respectively. The genome is obtained from chr1.fa
   and the output is simread_1.fq and simread_2.fq.
